# Wolvesville bot

A bot that plays Wolvesville custom games ("vill win" rooms) on its own,
24/7, headless - and a dashboard that shows what it is doing.

The bot speaks to the game server **directly**: it mints its own firebase
token from a refresh token, lists the open rooms over REST and plays over
socket.io.  No browser, no screen, no clicking - just the Python standard
library, so it runs happily inside Termux on a phone.

## The one thing that needs a browser

Only the **first login**.  The sign-in endpoint wants a Cloudflare
attestation that only a real browser can produce.  Once you have logged
in once, the `refreshToken` is the durable credential: it mints new
idTokens for as long as it lives, and nothing else needs a browser.

```bash
cd web
npm install
node login.mjs            # opens a visible browser - you log in there
```

`login.mjs` stores the session in `web/state/` and prints the refresh
token.  Copy it to the phone (see below); from then on the phone runs
completely on its own.

## Run it on the phone (the mini PC)

```bash
# on the phone, inside Termux
sh ~/deploy.sh             # unpack the package, store the refresh token
sh ~/bot_start.sh          # start the bot in the background
```

* The bot keeps the CPU awake (`termux-wake-lock`) and starts itself
  after every reboot (`Termux:Boot`).
* The dashboard is on port 8787 of the phone.  From the laptop:

```bash
adb forward tcp:8787 tcp:8787     # then open http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

or open `http://<phone-ip>:8787/` directly on the same Wi-Fi.

## Check what it is doing

```bash
python wv-bot/tools/status.py --events
```

Prints status, phase, room, role, XP, restarts, errors, the processes on
the phone and the last events.  The same numbers are on the dashboard.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | `waiting for login` -> `looking for room` -> `joining` -> `playing` -> `game-over` -> `reconnecting` |
| `errors` / `reconnects` | both should stay flat while things are fine |
| `uptime_sec` | how long the current session has been running |
| `xp_total` / `games_played` | the harvest |
| `banned` | the server banned the account; the bot waits the ban out |

## The other host: a browser

The original design drove the official web client in a headless Firefox
and injected a script into the page.  That still exists and is useful
when the protocol mode runs into a Cloudflare challenge:

```bash
cd web
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
node bot.mjs --login     # log in once in a visible browser
node bot.mjs             # run headless
node bot.mjs --headed    # run with a visible browser (debugging)
```

Both runners inject the same `web/payload.js`, so the behaviour is
identical.

## Layout

```
wv-bot/
  run.py            launcher for the phone (protocol mode by default)
  setcreds.py       stores the account credentials on the device (mode 600)
  config.json       template (the real one lives in ~/.wv-bot/)
  wvbot/            python side: supervisor, socket.io client, api, dashboard
  web/              node side: playwright runner + the shared payload
  tools/            packaging, deployment, probes and the status helper
  tests/            stdlib unittest suite, run from wv-bot/ (see below)
  docs/RE-NOTES.md  everything that was learned about the protocol
```

## Development

The bot is standard library only, and so are its tests:

```bash
cd wv-bot
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Every protocol fix lands with a test first; the suite covers the payload
parsing, the XP tables, the game events, the vote policy, the history,
the pacing and the config load order.

## Configuration (the live one sits in `~/.wv-bot/config.json` on the phone)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `room_names` | `["vill win"]` | word-matched against the room list |
| `delay_min_sec` / `delay_max_sec` | 45 / 150 | the wait between two games, drawn at random |
| `joins_per_hour` | 12 | past this the bot waits 5 extra minutes per round |
| `room_skip_chance` | 0.15 | chance to leave a matching room alone this round |
| `daily_restart_hour` | 4 | the process re-executes itself at this local hour (`null` = off) |
| `silence_timeout_sec` | 300 | a game with no events for this long is restarted |
| `allow_password_rooms` / `room_password` | false / "" | join locked rooms (when they share one password) |
| `claim_daily_rewards` | true | the daily ladder rung whose date has arrived |
| `open_loot_boxes` | true | open the loot boxes between games |
| `spin_golden_wheel` | false | spin the wheel when it costs at most `wheel_max_roses` |
| `chat_enabled` / `chat_messages` | false / [] | the optional greeting (30% chance per game) |
| `dashboard_host` / `dashboard_port` | 0.0.0.0 / 8787 | where the status panel listens |

## The two modes

| Mode | Command | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| protocol | `python3 run.py` (default) | a refresh token |
| web | `python3 run.py --mode web` | a browser (headless Firefox on the phone) |

The protocol mode is the default because it needs nothing but the Python
standard library.
